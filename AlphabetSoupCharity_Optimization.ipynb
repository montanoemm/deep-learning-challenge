    "*First model or Base Model.- Included two hidden layers with 2 and 4 nodes each. The manipulation of the data was limited to the instructions provided by the instructors. Accuracy 0.72\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Second Model or First Optimization.- Decided to include the column 'NAME' in the dataset for training in order to help the model with the identification of successful companies. Any names with less than 10 repetitions were replaced with the other category. The number of hidden layers remained the same as the original model. Accuracy 0.76\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Third Model or Second Optimization.- The manipulation of the data remained the same as the second model, but more nodes were added. First hidden layer had 8 nodes and the second hidden layer had 16 nodes. Accuracy 0.78\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "*Correctly manipulating the data or identifying usefull data to improve the quality of the data, had a more impact in the model accuracy than the model architecture. However, the model architecture can negatively impact your results if not careful, due to overfitting."
